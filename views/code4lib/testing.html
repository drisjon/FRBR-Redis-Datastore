 <h3>BBD</h3>
 <p>The <a href="/background/loc_framework.html">Library of Congress 
    Bibliographic Framework for Digital Works</a>, along with other metadata
    standards and schemas such as RDA, FRBR specification, as well as 
    technical documentation is used to create the unit testing of specific
    code in <a href="#">FRBR-to-Redis Datastore</a>.Described user sceniarios or use cases are especially valued as BBD features are
    created for each and then tested to see if the datastore can meet
    this user requirement.
